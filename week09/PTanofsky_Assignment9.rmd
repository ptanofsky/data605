# Problem 1

The price of one share of stock in the Pilsdorff Beer Company (see Exercise 8.2.12) is given by $Y_n$ on the $n$th day of the year. Finn observes that the differences $X_n = Y_{n+1} - Y_n$ appear to be independent random variables with a common distribution having mean $\mu = 0$ and variance $\sigma^2 = 1/4$. If $Y_1 = 100$, estimate the probability that $Y_{365}$ is
