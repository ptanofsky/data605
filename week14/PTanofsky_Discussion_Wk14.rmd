# Prompt

Pick any exercise in 8.8 of the calculus textbook.  Solve and post your solution.  If you have issues doing so, discuss them. 

# Exercise 8.8.3

Key Idea 8.8.1 gives the $n^{th}$ term of the Taylor series of common functions. In Exercises 3â€“6, verify the formula given in the Key Idea by finding the first few terms of the Taylor series of the given function and identifying a pattern.

$$f(x)=e^x; c=0$$

## From Key Idea 8.8.1

#### Function and series

$$e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}$$

#### First Few Terms

$$1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + ...$$

#### Interval of Convergence

$$(-\infty, \infty)$$
**Note:** The derivative of $e^x$ is also $e^x$

$$f(x) = e^x,\ thus\ f'(x) = e^x\ and\ f''(x) = e^x $$
So that being confirmed, then

$$f(0)= 1 = f'(0) = f''(0) = f'''(0) = f''''(0)$$
As the question defines the center at 0, this will follow a Maclaurin series.

#### Maclaurin polynomial of degree n of f:

$$p_n(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \frac{f'''(0)}{3!}x^3 + ... + \frac{f^n(0)}{n!}x^n$$
So substitute for $f(0)$ and derivatives, which results in for $e^x$

$$p_n(x) = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3 + ... + \frac{1}{n!}x^n$$
Solving for $p_5(x)$ to approximate the value of $e$ when $x = 1$

$$p_5 = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3 + \frac{1}{24}x^4 + \frac{1}{120}x^5$$
Thus

$$p_5(1) = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} + \frac{1}{120} = \frac{163}{60} = 2.71667$$

Given the pattern observed from $p_n(x)$, the resulting summation is equal to the key idea series from 8.8.1

$$e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}$$

### Solving with R

Using the taylor function from the pracma library

```{r}
library(pracma)
x <- function(x) exp(x)
result <- taylor(x, 0, 5)
result
sum(result)
```

The summation `r sum(result)` equals the calculated value above.
